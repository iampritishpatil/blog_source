My name is Pritish Patil. I am a 4th year undergraduate at Indian Institute of Science, Banglore. I am interested in neuroscience, especially computational neuroscience and am planning to do a PhD in it.

"saske je cmaci" is [Lojban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban "to the extent I understand lojban") for science and math which are my major obsessions. Other obsessions include comics (like [xkcd](http://xkcd.com)), music (like [Taylor Swift](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=taylor+swift "Yeah, you really shouldn't have questions about who she is.")), linux (like, umm ... [linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)) and reading ... lots of reading.
